## Abstract
　　With the development of science and technology, the data size and
complexity of scientific data are increased rapidly, which made efficient data
storage and parallel analysis of scientific data become a big challenge. The
previous techniques that combine the traditional relational database with analysis
software tends cannot efficiently meet the performance requirement of large
scale scientific data based analysis. In this paper, we present FASTDB, a distributed
array database system that optimized for massive scientific data management
and provide a share-nothing, parallel array processing analysis. In order
to demonstrate the intrinsic performance characteristics of FASTDB, we applied
it into the interactive analysis of data from astronomical surveys, and designed a
series of experiments with scientific analysis tasks. According to the experimental
results, we found FASTDB can be significantly fast than traditional
database based SkyServer in many typical analytical scenarios.
