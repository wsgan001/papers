### ABSTRACT
SciDB is a new open-source data management system
intended primarily for use in application domains that
involve very large (petabyte) scale array data; for example,
scientific applications such as astronomy, remote sensing and
climate modeling, bio-science information management, as
well as commercial applications such as risk management
systems in the financial services sector, and the analysis of
web log data. In this talk we will describe our set of motivating
examples and use them to explain the features of SciDB.
We then provide a snapshot of the project ‘in flight’, describing
our novel storage manager, array data model, query language,
and extensibility frameworks.
