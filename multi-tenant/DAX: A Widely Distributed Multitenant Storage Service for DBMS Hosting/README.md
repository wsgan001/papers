#DAX: A Widely Distributed Multi-tenant Storage Service for DBMS Hosting

## ABSTRACT
　Many applications hosted on the cloud have sophisticated　data management needs that are best served by a SQL-based　relational DBMS. It is not dicult to run a DBMS in the　cloud, and in many cases one DBMS instance is enough to　support an application's workload. However, a DBMS running　in the cloud (or even on a local server) still needs a　way to persistently store its data and protect it against failures.　One way to achieve this is to provide a scalable and　reliable storage service that the DBMS can access over a　network. This paper describes such a service, which we call　DAX. DAX relies on multi-master replication and Dynamostyleexible consistency, which enables it to run in multiple　data centers and hence be disaster tolerant. Flexible
consistency allows DAX to control the consistency level of
each read or write operation, choosing between strong consistency
at the cost of high latency or weak consistency with
low latency. DAX makes this choice for each read or write
operation by applying protocols that we designed based on
the storage tier usage characteristics of database systems.
With these protocols, DAX provides a storage service that
can host multiple DBMS tenants, scaling with the number
of tenants and the required storage capacity and bandwidth.
DAX also provides high availability and disaster tolerance
for the DBMS storage tier. Experiments using the TPC-C
benchmark show that DAX provides up to a factor of 4 performance
improvement over baseline solutions that do not
exploit 
exible consistency.
