# Database statistics for optimization of database queries containing user-defined functions
US 20090112799A1

## ABSTRACT
Embodiments of the invention provide techniques for gener
ating statistics for optimizing database queries containing
user-de?ned functions (UDFS). In general; the statistics may
be generated based on output values produced during past
executions of a UDF. The statistics may also be generated
based on input values received during past executions of the
UDF. Additionally; the statistics may include input and output
value pairs; such that a UDF output may be determined based
on a UDF input. The generated statistics may be used by a
query optimizer to determine an ef?cient query plan for
executing the database query.
