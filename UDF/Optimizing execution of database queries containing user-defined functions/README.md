# Optimizing execution of database queries containing user-defined functions
US 20080275858Al

## ABSTRACT
A query engine (or optimizer) Which supports database que
ries having user-de?ned functions maintains historical execu
tion data With respect to each of multiple user-de?ned func
tions. The historical execution data is dynamically updated
based on query execution performance. When executing a
query having user-de?ned functions, the query engine uses
the historical execution data to predict an optimal evaluation
ordering for the query conditions and, preferably, to dynami-
cally adjust the evaluation order When appropriate. Prefer-
ably, the historical execution data includes historical execu-
tion time of the user-de?ned function and proportion of
evaluated records Which satis?ed the query parameters.
